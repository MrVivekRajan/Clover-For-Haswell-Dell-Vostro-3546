# Latest-5144-Clover-For-Haswell-Dell-Vostro-3546
Hellow guys, today I am going to share latest clover for haswell based system.
I have tested this on macos Monterey and it works perfectly and I am sure it will work on any other version of macos.
In case you are trying it on different macos version and you get error like this version of macos is not supported then do update your SMBIOS and it should work perfectly.
I hope it works for everyone.
