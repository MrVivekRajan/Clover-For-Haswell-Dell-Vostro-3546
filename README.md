# Hello guys, today I am sharing latest clover-5144 for Dell vostro 3546(haswell system).
I have tested it and it works perfectly with macos Monterey and I am sure it will work for you as well in case you get any error like this version of macos is not supported,etc then do update your SMBIOS and it should work.
Hope it works for everyone who tries it.
